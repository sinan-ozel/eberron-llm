Brooches can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, or even moods; some brooches can mean \"leave me alone\" or \"looking for company.\" A dultar—blood blade—could also be worn as a dagger, both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance.

Seeking vengeance, he volunteered for special operations units seeking the orc warlords and their bands. After his mission was complete, Cal left the service for a time, searching for his family's killers among orc tribes. After a time, he settled in the town of Quickstone with the Grizzlies, the military veterans' organization of Brelish soldiers. Since then, Cal has been honing his skills and his vengeance, now turning to a new cause: hunting down the last of the orcs who still threaten the region.\n",

      "        1. Cal uses his hunter's mark ability and his fervor for vengeance to aim for high-value targets with surgical precision.\n",
      "        2. He tries to surround himself with allies who can provide cover or distract enemies while he unleashes his arrows.\n",

      "    As a soldier, Caelum \"Cal\" Iarwain of Breland served in the Last War with distinction. He was honored for capturing a high-level orc warlord and was released from military service with great fanfare. However, when he learned that his family was killed during the war by a band of orcs, he left the service, seeking vengeance.\n",
      "    Cal settled in the small town of Quickstone, where he now lives with other veterans of the war as part of the Grizzlies. As a ranger, Cal is an excellent shot with his shortbow and also carries a short sword for close combat. He is skilled at both stealth and survival, making him an excellent tracker.\n",
      "    Cal is driven by a desire for vengeance against the orcs who killed his family, and he is determined to track them down and take them out, regardless of political or social difficulties. He often patrols the forests of the region, searching for any sign of orc activity and is always alert for potential ambushes.\n",
      "    Cal is a skilled combatant and is careful to make every shot count. He often marks his targets with his hunter's mark ability, ensuring that his hits are especially devastating. He is also careful to keep his allies safe, often using his allies as a distraction or cover while he unleashes his arrows. When in close combat, Cal is equally adept, using his short sword to inflict heavy damage on his enemies.\n"

Overwhelmed by the sudden surge of arcane energy in its system, RedLight Disiuct p's creators infused it with their magical abilities.\n",

It took a pilgrimage through many of Khorvaire's nations, each encounter shaping its views, beliefs, and desires.\n",
      "    Intention: RedLight Disiuct p seeks to become a living testament to Sovereign Host's will, using its powers to protect the innocent and uphold Sovereign Host’s laws.\n",
      "    Tactics: In combat, RedLight Disiuct p aims to keep its distance and attack with spells, focusing on mass controlling and crowd-controlling spells first and then damaging or disabling enemies. It will never attack creatures that are under Sovereign Host's protection.\n",
      "    Visuals: RedLight Disiuct p stands 6 feet tall, with a sleek, streamlined body made out of grey iron. A small crystal is embedded in its chest, glowing softly and flickering blue when RedLight Disiuct p is casting spells. It wears simple robes and a hood, the hood pulled up to shield its face from view.

He wears a chain shirt, studded leather armor, and carries a heavy crossbow slung over his shoulder with a quiver of bolts by his side. When he’s not in combat, he is generally seen with a wand tucked into the bandoleer on his belt, ready at a moment’s notice. The wand itself is an ornate brass staff with intricate engravings, a gift from a comrade in the war. In his spare time, he frequents the pubs in the Tower of Jewels district, a neighborhood famed for its diverse clientele, hoping to spark a memory or two.\n"

Sick of the petty crimes they were committing, and tired of living hand to mouth, Cameron stumbled across a curious wand in one of the city's ancient ruins. This wand changed Cameron's life as he learned he had a natural talent with it, and with some help from a retired adventurer, Cameron became proficient with the wand - transforming himself into the city's premier wandslinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "    His performances gained the attention of the city watch, who hired Cameron to assist in dealing with rogue gangs and troublesome thieves, using his magical power for good. But the real test came when the Last War engulfed the continent, and the city of Siberys found itself at the epicenter.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Intentions:\n",
      "    C.C. is torn between the desire to help those in need and the hunger for gold and recognition that comes with the wandslinger career. He longs to do good, but is not above taking a bribe or two when the opportunity arises.\n",

      "    Tactics:\n",
      "    C.C. takes calculated shots, looking to disable or distract opponents before going in for the kill. He can often be found firing off shots from a safe distance, using his Assess Foe skill to predict when his opponents will be the most vulnerable.\n",
