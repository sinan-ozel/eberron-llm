       "The fashion in the Five Nations of Khorvaire, following the Last War, has evolved to reflect the distinct cultural identities of each nation. Common soldiers' armor typically consists of light or medium armor, with light armor involving a leather greatcoat or thick leather tunic, supplemented with heavy leather gauntlets and boots, or for better defense, metal shin guards and vambraces. Medium armor uses the same base—a long leather coat or vest—enhanced with a strong metal helmet and a breastplate. The breastplate of the common soldier is heavy and uses the statistics of scale mail, while officers and elite forces wear a finer, lighter design that uses breastplate statistics.\n",

       "\n",
       "Adventurers, an important part of each of the Five Nations, often wear bits and pieces of their home culture in their clothing. Examples include gloves and masks for a Cyran, gazyrs sewn onto leather armor for a Karrn, a cloak with strange proportions for an Aundairian, clothes covered in embroidered patches for a Thrane, or pointy-toed shoes and long puffy sleeves for a Brelish.\n",
       "\n",
       "Modern fashion designers now produce lines of fashion specifically for the adventurers of the world, catering to their unique and often hard-to-pin-down personalities. The identity of the Five Nations continues to be an important part of their cultural experience, even for those who were not born in their country proper. The pre-War Five Nations background grants equipment, skills, tools, and proficiencies specific to the nation you consider your homeland."

       "Backstory: Julio Azevepo served with distinction in the Brelish army during the Last War, fighting on the western front. After the war ended in 996 YK, he found himself among the many veterans who settled on the Western Frontier. He became a member of the Grizzlies, a militia in the town of Quickstone, where he now serves as a deputy under Sheriff Constable. His military service has left him with a deep-seated suspicion of Droaamites and their allies, a belief that has occasionally led to clashes with the Mourners, kobolds, and other non-Brelish inhabitants of the area.\n",
       "\n",
       "Long-term Goals: Julio's long-term goal is to maintain order in Quickstone and protect the town and its citizens from threats, both from within and without. He has a particularly strong desire to see Droaamites and their allies driven out of the region, and views his role in the Grizzlies as a means to that end. He also harbors a personal ambition to prove himself as a leader, both within the Grizzlies and in Breland as a whole.\n",

He is also in need of supplies for the Grizzlies, including weapons and equipment, as well as food and other necessary supplies for the camp. He is also keen to maintain the loyalty and support of his fellow Grizzlies, and to keep them from causing trouble with the Mourners and other non-Brelish inhabitants of the area.\n",

He is also suspicious of outsiders, particularly those who are not Brelish, and is quick to assume the worst about them. He is fiercely loyal to Breland and Count ir'Blis, and is willing to go to great lengths to protect them and their interests.\n",

       "**Backstory:** Cameron Jones was born and raised in the bustling city of Sharn, Breland. Growing up, he was always drawn to the arcane and the magical, fascinated by the wandslingers, the new breed of soldiers who could harness magic on the battlefield. When the Last War broke out, he saw an opportunity to serve his nation and follow his passion. He enlisted in the Brelish army and was trained as a wandslinger, quickly rising through the ranks thanks to his natural aptitude for arcane combat.\n",
       "\n",
       "During the war, Cameron distinguished himself with acts of bravery and tactical genius. His unit, the Lion's Roar, became known for their daring charges and fearsome power on the battlefield. However, the war took its toll on Cameron, both physically and emotionally. He lost many close comrades, and the horrors of war haunt his dreams to this day.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the end of the war, Cameron was honorably discharged and returned to Sharn. He initially struggled to adapt to civilian life, feeling lost without the structure and purpose that the army provided. But his love for magic and his desire to help his nation never waned. He used his skills and connections to become a renowned wandslinger for hire, often taking on dangerous jobs that others would shun.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Long-term Goals:** Cameron's long-term goal is to prove that wandslingers are more than just battlefield warriors. He hopes to use his skills to help rebuild Breland and make it a safer, more prosperous place. He also aspires to establish a school or academy for young wandslingers, teaching them the arts of arcane combat and instilling in them a sense of duty and honor.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Immediate Wants and Needs:** In the short term, Cameron is seeking to establish himself as a reliable and highly skilled wandslinger for hire. He needs to find steady work that allows him to pay his bills and maintain his equipment. He is also looking to reconnect with old comrades from the Lion's Roar, to share stories and reminisce about the good old days.\n",

       "Backstory:\n",
       "Cameron Calamity Jones is a Brelish war veteran who served as a wandslinger during the Last War. Originally a non-combatant with a background in arcane studies, Cameron was drafted into the Brelish military and trained to wield a wand in combat. He quickly rose through the ranks, earning a reputation as a formidable and relentless combatant, earning him the nickname \"Calamity\" from his peers. After the war, Cameron returned to Breland and settled in Quickstone, taking up a position as a sheriff's deputy and using his skills as a wandslinger to maintain law and order in the town and surrounding areas.\n",
       "\n",
       "Long-term Goals:\n",
       "Cameron's long-term goal is to one day be appointed as the sheriff of Quickstone and build a strong and respected force to protect the town and its citizens. He also hopes to build a peaceful and prosperous future for Breland, and to help the nation rebuild after the destruction caused by the Last War.\n",
       "\n",
       "Immediate Wants and Needs:\n",
       "Cameron is currently focused on maintaining law and order in Quickstone, and is always on the lookout for troublemakers and criminals who threaten the peace. He is also in constant need of supplies and equipment to maintain his wand and keep it functioning properly, as well as medical supplies to treat any injuries sustained during his duties.\n",
       "\n",
       "Personality Traits:\n",
       "Cameron is a disciplined and driven individual, with a strong sense of duty to his country and his community. He is also fiercely independent and stubborn, and is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, even if it means going against authority. He is deeply protective of those he cares about, and will stop at nothing to protect them from harm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Secrets:\n",
       "Cameron has a dark secret from his time in the war: he was responsible for the death of a fellow soldier who had threatened to reveal a scandal involving a high-ranking officer. Cameron has spent years living with the guilt of this act, and is haunted by the memory of his former comrade. He has also been secretly training a young Brelish soldier, believing that he can help the young man reach his full potential and become a valuable asset to the Brelish military.\n",
       "\n",
       "Relevant D&D 5e Skill Checks:\n",
       "Players may be able to notice Cameron's proficiency with Smith's Tools, as he is constantly maintaining and repairing his wand. They may also be able to spot that he is a wandslinger by observing his wand at rest on his belt, or by witnessing him casting spells during combat. With a successful Investigation check, players may be able to discover Cameron's dark secret, or overhear him talking to his secret trainee. With a successful Persuasion check, players may be able to convince Cameron to look the other way in certain situations, or to provide them with information or assistance.Character Name: Cameron Calamity Jones\n",

Brooches can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, or even moods; some brooches can mean \"leave me alone\" or \"looking for company.\" A dultar—blood blade—could also be worn as a dagger, both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance. The dultar's style could help identify the heir's clan, as each ruling clan has a distinct style of dultar.\n",

Seeking vengeance, he volunteered for special operations units seeking the orc warlords and their bands. After his mission was complete, Cal left the service for a time, searching for his family's killers among orc tribes. After a time, he settled in the town of Quickstone with the Grizzlies, the military veterans' organization of Brelish soldiers. Since then, Cal has been honing his skills and his vengeance, now turning to a new cause: hunting down the last of the orcs who still threaten the region.\n",
      "    25. Intentions:\n",

      "        1. Cal uses his hunter's mark ability and his fervor for vengeance to aim for high-value targets with surgical precision.\n",
      "        2. He tries to surround himself with allies who can provide cover or distract enemies while he unleashes his arrows.\n",

He was honored for capturing a high-level orc warlord and was released from military service with great fanfare. However, when he learned that his family was killed during the war by a band of orcs, he left the service, seeking vengeance.\n",
      "    Cal settled in the small town of Quickstone, where he now lives with other veterans of the war as part of the Grizzlies. As a ranger, Cal is an excellent shot with his shortbow and also carries a short sword for close combat. He is skilled at both stealth and survival, making him an excellent tracker.\n",
      "    Cal is driven by a desire for vengeance against the orcs who killed his family, and he is determined to track them down and take them out, regardless of political or social difficulties. He often patrols the forests of the region, searching for any sign of orc activity and is always alert for potential ambushes.\n",
      "    Cal is a skilled combatant and is careful to make every shot count. He often marks his targets with his hunter's mark ability, ensuring that his hits are especially devastating. He is also careful to keep his allies safe, often using his allies as a distraction or cover while he unleashes his arrows. When in close combat, Cal is equally adept, using his short sword to inflict heavy damage on his enemies.\n"
