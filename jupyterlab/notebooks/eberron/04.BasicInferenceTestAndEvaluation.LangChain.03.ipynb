       "In the Five Nations, fashion is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs and practicality. The Church of the Silver Flame, Sovereign Host, and the Seekers of the Dawn are the three largest religions, and their followers' attire reflects their beliefs.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the Church of the Silver Flame, practicality is key. Priests often wear heavy fabrics like indigo- and silver-dyed denim, with long-sleeved robes reaching halfway down the calf, closed down the front to the waist with silver toggles, and long slits up the sides for mobility. A cowl or mantle is worn over the robe, which hangs lower in the back, closed with a single toggle at the neck. The vestments are either painted, dyed, or embroidered with silver pigments or threads.\n",

       "During the Last War, the soldiers of the Five Nations all served in the united army of Galifar. Over the century of war, styles evolved, with each nation striving to distinguish its soldiers and improve their tools of war. Common soldiers typically wore light armor, which involved a leather greatcoat or thick leather tunic, supplemented with heavy leather gauntlets and boots, or for better defense, metal shin guards and vambraces. Medium armor used the same base—a long leather coat or vest—enhanced with a strong metal helmet and a breastplate. Heavy armor was more distinctive between nations, with examples like the Brelish equivalent of splint mail combining a breastplate with a layer of chainmail, while Karrnathi splint mail is light plate.\n",
       "\n",
       "Each nation has its own distinct approach to fashion, both in its armor and civilian clothing. For instance, Breland's \"leatherback scouts\" might wear hide armor if a ranger with the soldier background chooses to do so. Beyond this, every nation has its own unique fashion style."

       "The fashion in the Five Nations of Khorvaire, following the Last War, has evolved to reflect the distinct cultural identities of each nation. Common soldiers' armor typically consists of light or medium armor, with light armor involving a leather greatcoat or thick leather tunic, supplemented with heavy leather gauntlets and boots, or for better defense, metal shin guards and vambraces. Medium armor uses the same base—a long leather coat or vest—enhanced with a strong metal helmet and a breastplate. The breastplate of the common soldier is heavy and uses the statistics of scale mail, while officers and elite forces wear a finer, lighter design that uses breastplate statistics.\n",

       "\n",
       "Adventurers, an important part of each of the Five Nations, often wear bits and pieces of their home culture in their clothing. Examples include gloves and masks for a Cyran, gazyrs sewn onto leather armor for a Karrn, a cloak with strange proportions for an Aundairian, clothes covered in embroidered patches for a Thrane, or pointy-toed shoes and long puffy sleeves for a Brelish.\n",

       "Modern fashion designers now produce lines of fashion specifically for the adventurers of the world, catering to their unique and often hard-to-pin-down personalities. The identity of the Five Nations continues to be an important part of their cultural experience, even for those who were not born in their country proper. The pre-War Five Nations background grants equipment, skills, tools, and proficiencies specific to the nation you consider your homeland."

       "Backstory: Julio Azevepo served with distinction in the Brelish army during the Last War, fighting on the western front. After the war ended in 996 YK, he found himself among the many veterans who settled on the Western Frontier. He became a member of the Grizzlies, a militia in the town of Quickstone, where he now serves as a deputy under Sheriff Constable. His military service has left him with a deep-seated suspicion of Droaamites and their allies, a belief that has occasionally led to clashes with the Mourners, kobolds, and other non-Brelish inhabitants of the area.\n",
       "\n",
       "Long-term Goals: Julio's long-term goal is to maintain order in Quickstone and protect the town and its citizens from threats, both from within and without. He has a particularly strong desire to see Droaamites and their allies driven out of the region, and views his role in the Grizzlies as a means to that end. He also harbors a personal ambition to prove himself as a leader, both within the Grizzlies and in Breland as a whole.\n",

       "Immediate Wants and Needs: Julio is currently focused on investigating a series of recent crimes in Quickstone, which he believes are being perpetrated by Droaamites or their sympathizers. He is also in need of supplies for the Grizzlies, including weapons and equipment, as well as food and other necessary supplies for the camp. He is also keen to maintain the loyalty and support of his fellow Grizzlies, and to keep them from causing trouble with the Mourners and other non-Brelish inhabitants of the area.\n",

       "Personality Traits: Julio is a pragmatic and disciplined individual, with a strong sense of duty and a tendency to view problems as obstacles to be overcome rather than insurmountable challenges. He is also suspicious of outsiders, particularly those who are not Brelish, and is quick to assume the worst about them. He is fiercely loyal to Breland and Count ir'Blis, and is willing to go to great lengths to protect them and their interests.\n",

       "Cameron Calamity Jones served as a Wandslinger in the Brelish army during the Last War. He was a prodigy with arcane magic, selected for the elite Wandslinger unit at a young age. He quickly rose through the ranks, gaining the reputation as the \"Calamity\" for his fearless battle style and his uncanny ability to turn the tide of a battle with a well-placed spell.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the war raged on, Cameron became disillusioned with the political machinations that drove the conflict and began to question the motives of his superiors. He grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of strategic thought and the focus on attrition rather than victory.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the final years of the war, Cameron and his fellow Wandslingers were sent on a covert mission deep into enemy territory. Their objective was to sabotage an enemy castle and gather intelligence. The mission was a success, but the cost was high; Cameron lost several comrades, including his best friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "The aftermath of the war found Cameron struggling to reconcile his idealism and his experiences on the battlefield. He returned to Quickstone, where he found the town had changed dramatically. Count ir'Blis, who had been a strong supporter of the war, seemed less concerned with rebuilding and more focused on consolidating power.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cameron joined the Grizzlies, hoping to make a difference in the community and to help keep the peace. However, he remains haunted by the memories of the war and the lives lost. He has not yet found a way to move on, and he continues to struggle with feelings of guilt and anger.\n",
       "\n",
       "Long-term Goals:\n",
       "Cameron's long-term goal is to find a way to put his magical abilities to use for the greater good. He believes that his skills could be valuable in maintaining peace and justice in Quickstone and the wider Breland. However, he is still unsure how best to accomplish this and spends a lot of time considering his options.\n",

       "Cameron Calamity Jones is a Brelish war veteran who served as a wandslinger during the Last War. Originally a non-combatant with a background in arcane studies, Cameron was drafted into the Brelish military and trained to wield a wand in combat. He quickly rose through the ranks, earning a reputation as a formidable and relentless combatant, earning him the nickname \"Calamity\" from his peers. After the war, Cameron returned to Breland and settled in Quickstone, taking up a position as a sheriff's deputy and using his skills as a wandslinger to maintain law and order in the town and surrounding areas.\n",

       "Immediate Wants and Needs:\n",
       "Cameron is currently focused on maintaining law and order in Quickstone, and is always on the lookout for troublemakers and criminals who threaten the peace.

       "\n",
       "Secrets:\n",
       "Cameron has a dark secret from his time in the war: he was responsible for the death of a fellow soldier who had threatened to reveal a scandal involving a high-ranking officer.

He has also been secretly training a young Brelish soldier, believing that he can help the young man reach his full potential and become a valuable asset to the Brelish military.\n",

Brooches can depict family crests, the seal of the ruling clan, or even moods; some brooches can mean \"leave me alone\" or \"looking for company.\" A dultar—blood blade—could also be worn as a dagger, both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance.

Seeking vengeance, he volunteered for special operations units seeking the orc warlords and their bands. After his mission was complete, Cal left the service for a time, searching for his family's killers among orc tribes. After a time, he settled in the town of Quickstone with the Grizzlies, the military veterans' organization of Brelish soldiers. Since then, Cal has been honing his skills and his vengeance, now turning to a new cause: hunting down the last of the orcs who still threaten the region.\n",

      "        2. He tries to surround himself with allies who can provide cover or distract enemies while he unleashes his arrows.\n",

He was honored for capturing a high-level orc warlord and was released from military service with great fanfare. However, when he learned that his family was killed during the war by a band of orcs, he left the service, seeking vengeance.\n",
      "    Cal settled in the small town of Quickstone, where he now lives with other veterans of the war as part of the Grizzlies. As a ranger, Cal is an excellent shot with his shortbow and also carries a short sword for close combat. He is skilled at both stealth and survival, making him an excellent tracker.\n",
      "    Cal is driven by a desire for vengeance against the orcs who killed his family, and he is determined to track them down and take them out, regardless of political or social difficulties. He often patrols the forests of the region, searching for any sign of orc activity and is always alert for potential ambushes.\n",
      "    Cal is a skilled combatant and is careful to make every shot count. He often marks his targets with his hunter's mark ability, ensuring that his hits are especially devastating. He is also careful to keep his allies safe, often using his allies as a distraction or cover while he unleashes his arrows. When in close combat, Cal is equally adept, using his short sword to inflict heavy damage on his enemies.\n"

      "    Born on the streets of Siberys, Cameron Calamity Jones (C.C. to his friends) grew up as an orphan with no other family besides the gang he and his siblings ran with. Sick of the petty crimes they were committing, and tired of living hand to mouth, Cameron stumbled across a curious wand in one of the city's ancient ruins. This wand changed Cameron's life as he learned he had a natural talent with it, and with some help from a retired adventurer, Cameron became proficient with the wand - transforming himself into the city's premier wandslinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "    His performances gained the attention of the city watch, who hired Cameron to assist in dealing with rogue gangs and troublesome thieves, using his magical power for good. But the real test came when the Last War engulfed the continent, and the city of Siberys found itself at the epicenter.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Intentions:\n",
      "    C.C. is torn between the desire to help those in need and the hunger for gold and recognition that comes with the wandslinger career. He longs to do good, but is not above taking a bribe or two when the opportunity arises.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Tactics:\n",
      "    C.C. takes calculated shots, looking to disable or distract opponents before going in for the kill. He can often be found firing off shots from a safe distance, using his Assess Foe skill to predict when his opponents will be the most vulnerable.\n",

      "    Inventory:\n",
      "    - Ring of feather fall\n",
      "    - Wand (Crystal)\n",
